        <h2>History</h2>
        <p> In the Netflix series, one of the episodes is dedicated to a game that is all about candy and shapes. Talk about getting back to the ‘good old days.’ However, it is time we learn more about Dalgona candy and where it comes from. 
            Dalgona candy became popular in South Korea after the Korean War of 1950. People who couldn’t afford expensive American candies and chocolates devised their own way of getting sweets into their system. 
            Also known as honeycomb toffee, the candy is super simple. It uses literally only two ingredients—sugar and baking soda. The fun shapes that are stamped onto them later are all about entertainment and making it fun.
            As this was a low-cost street snack from the start, it makes sense that the candy is cheap and easy to make. People used to make it at home, and after Squid Game has put it back on the popularity radar, many have gone back to making the candy at home and filming it too!
