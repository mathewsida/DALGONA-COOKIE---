        <h1>Dalgona Cookies Recipe</h1>
        <h3>History</h3>

        <img src= "https://t1.daumcdn.net/news/202110/01/chosun/20211001145158740swlx.jpg"width="560">


        <p1> In the Netflix series, one of the episodes is dedicated to a game that is all about candy and shapes. Talk about getting back to the ‘good old days.’ However, it is time we learn more about Dalgona candy and where it comes from. 
        <p2>Dalgona candy became popular in South Korea after the Korean War of 1950. People who couldn’t afford expensive American candies and chocolates devised their own way of getting sweets into their system. 
        <p3>Also known as honeycomb toffee, the candy is super simple. It uses literally only two ingredients—sugar and baking soda. The fun shapes that are stamped onto them later are all about entertainment and making it fun.
        <p4>As this was a low-cost street snack from the start, it makes sense that the candy is cheap and easy to make. People used to make it at home, and after Squid Game has put it back on the popularity radar, many have gone back to making the candy at home and filming it too!

     <h1>Dalgona Candy Method</h1>
      
    <ol>
        <li>Add the sugar to a medium metal ladle.</li>
        <li>Over medium-low heat, begin melting the sugar. Constantly stir the sugar with a chopstick or heat-proof spatula.
            If the sugar begins to smoke or burn, remove it from the heat for 5-10 seconds while stirring, then return it to the heat.
        </li> 
        <li>Once all the sugar has melted and turned an amber color, remove the ladle from the heat. 
            Add the baking soda and stir thoroughly to incorporate. Return the ladle to the heat for 2-5 seconds at a time to keep the sugar mixture hot. 
        </li>
        <li>Pour the homogenous sugar mixture onto a non-stick heat-proof surface.
            Allow the mixture to cool for 30-45 seconds or until the surface temperature reaches 275°F.
        </li>
        <li>Once the mixture has cooled a bit and is no longer sticky, compress the sugar with a circular metal press. </li>
        <li>Quickly remove the press from the surface of the candy and gently press the design cutter of choice into the center of the wafer.
            Make sure not to cut all the way through the sugar.
        </li>
        <li>Allow the dalgona to cool on the non-stick surface for 2-3 minutes before using a metal spatula to detach the wafer.</li>
        <li>Allow the candy to cool fully before consuming.</li>

     </ol>

     <h1>Dalgona Coffee Method</h1>

     <ol>
         <li>Combine the coffee, sugar, and water in a bowl. </li>
         <li>Whip the mixture with a whisk or with an electric mixture until thick and fluffy.</li>
         <li>Add ice and milk to a glass and top with the whipped coffee. </li>
     </ol>
